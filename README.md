# Ochi Design Clone

This project is a clone of the visually stunning and highly interactive [Ochi Design](https://ochi.design) website. It aims to replicate the original site's design and functionality using modern web development technologies. This clone serves as a showcase of my proficiency in frontend development, particularly in creating responsive and interactive web experiences.
